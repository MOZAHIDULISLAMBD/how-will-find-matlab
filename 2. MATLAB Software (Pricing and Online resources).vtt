00:09.900 --> 00:15.750
Before starting the course let me introduce you to the Matlab software itself and the online help that

00:15.750 --> 00:17.990
is available for this software.

00:18.000 --> 00:25.740
So if we open up Google or dot com and write Matlab in the search bar then the first website is the

00:25.740 --> 00:28.750
official website of the Matlab software.

00:28.770 --> 00:32.930
The first thing you may notice is it's pricing.

00:33.030 --> 00:36.700
Remember that it comes in four different types of pricing.

00:36.840 --> 00:46.110
If we click here or we may know more about it for example the first one is the standard software pricing.

00:46.110 --> 00:49.180
Most of the cases will not be needing it.

00:49.380 --> 00:54.320
It's a two thousand three hundred and fifty US dollars.

00:54.330 --> 00:57.570
Then we have the educational version of the software.

00:57.600 --> 01:00.540
This is around five hundred U.S. dollars.

01:00.570 --> 01:05.520
Again we have the homework which is around 85 US dollars.

01:05.640 --> 01:11.730
And then there is the student version which is only 29 US dollars.

01:11.730 --> 01:17.850
Remember that basically there are a lot of add on products which are essentially the toolboxes that

01:17.850 --> 01:19.650
the Matlab provides.

01:19.650 --> 01:28.210
So if you add additional toolboxes it will cost you additional $16 each per toolbox.

01:28.230 --> 01:31.390
So what kind of tool boxes are there in the Martlet.

01:31.530 --> 01:39.240
Well there are so many for example from the bioinformatics to man from the Image Processing domain and

01:39.240 --> 01:40.520
so many others.

01:40.920 --> 01:45.630
So you can always optimize it based on your specific situation.

01:45.630 --> 01:50.570
For example we can see available aid on products list or here.

01:51.510 --> 01:53.880
So we know that there are many.

01:53.880 --> 01:58.160
For example we have one from the computational biology.

01:58.220 --> 02:03.970
Another one from finance control systems data science machine learning and many others.

02:04.260 --> 02:10.800
And the good thing about it is that you can always use the links that are being provided in order to

02:10.800 --> 02:15.330
browse what actually these two boxes contain.

02:15.330 --> 02:21.120
For instance if you are interested in the bioinformatics domain so you may click here and you may get

02:21.120 --> 02:28.170
more information regarding different facilities that are available while using this particular toolbox.

02:28.170 --> 02:35.490
You may notice the functions or you may look at the documentation's or some apps that are being provided

02:35.490 --> 02:36.270
to you.

02:36.360 --> 02:43.260
So these areas are essentially the boltin a function of programs aren't functions that people have written

02:43.260 --> 02:47.360
for you and you just need to use it.

02:48.090 --> 02:50.270
So what about the pricing.

02:50.280 --> 02:58.440
The good thing is that in in some institutes they really have free worsens for their students so they

02:58.440 --> 03:01.620
buy it in bulk and then they give it to the students.

03:01.650 --> 03:08.160
So check with your institute if they can provide you with a free copy and if you are a student they

03:08.160 --> 03:14.770
will definitely have a free version for you if that is not the case then you can buy for only $29.

03:15.060 --> 03:15.600
Right.

03:15.610 --> 03:19.040
The next thing is about community health.

03:19.230 --> 03:25.950
We have a large community of online contributors for this software and here are some of the statistics

03:26.040 --> 03:32.570
that we have there that we have these many contributors and these many questions per day.

03:32.580 --> 03:34.530
There is one 20 questions per day.

03:34.830 --> 03:38.770
There are a whole bunch of other useful information on this website.

03:38.840 --> 03:45.060
One more interesting thing is for example if you are looking for some code you may have a better look

03:45.100 --> 03:49.800
at here in the file exchange in the file exchange.

03:49.800 --> 03:56.110
We have a functions which the people are developing by themselves and then they contributed over who

03:56.140 --> 03:56.840
were here.

03:56.850 --> 04:01.790
And we also have Eppes examples videos and many other resources.

04:01.800 --> 04:09.690
So basically when you do advanced programming in Matlab you may not be able to get the answers of each

04:09.690 --> 04:15.930
and every questions directly or alternatively you may be looking for some specific scenario for which

04:15.930 --> 04:17.760
you are looking for an answer.

04:17.790 --> 04:24.120
So the best place to look for the answers or specific problems is to search it over a year.

04:24.120 --> 04:31.050
The other interesting place that you may be interested on this website and that may be of interest to

04:31.050 --> 04:32.850
you is the support section.

04:32.850 --> 04:35.820
So for instance you can write anything over here.

04:35.850 --> 04:42.300
For example I am interested in the definition of the function called Mean which computes the average.

04:42.330 --> 04:43.850
So I will go to this approach.

04:43.980 --> 04:47.040
So in support again we have so many different options.

04:47.040 --> 04:53.460
For instance when I look at the answers or at the file exchange repository or the examples.

04:53.640 --> 04:58.040
Additionally we have a lot of videos that people try to contribute here.

04:58.410 --> 05:05.070
So in conclusion it is your best website and if you are stuck with some very specific problem that you

05:05.070 --> 05:12.130
find difficult and you are looking for possible solutions then your place there was a little interaction

05:12.130 --> 05:14.380
of the Matlab software and its pricing.

05:14.390 --> 05:15.610
See when the course.
